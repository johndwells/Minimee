#Minimee

* Author: [John D Wells](http://johndwells.com)

## Version 1.1.5

### Requirements:

* PHP5
* ExpressionEngine 2.1 or later
* For HTML Minification, EE2.4 or later is required

## Description

Minimize, combine & cache your CSS and JS files. Minify your HTML. Because size DOES matter.

Minimee is to EE2 what SL Combinator is to EE1.  But with a few twists:

* for EE2.4 and above, can minify your HTML
* works with the global variables, even {stylesheet}
* works with external files, over cURL or file_get_contents()
* embed combined & minified content directly inline to your template
* queue files for later
* compatible with server-side compression & caching
